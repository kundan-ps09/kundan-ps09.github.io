      <hr>
		<p>This tutorial describe the technology stack on whch AEM is built. The stack can be divided as follows</p>
     <div class="jumbotron">
          <h4>Java Platform</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Java Runtime Environment (JRE 1.6 minimum. JRE 1.7 recommended)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Granite Platform ()</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>OSGi Framework (encapsulates all subsequent elements)</li>
            <li>CQSE Servlet Engine (optional external application server(Jetty))</li>
            <li>CRX Content Repository</li>
            <li>Sling Content Delivery</li>
            <li>Runs on JRE</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Abobe Experience Manager Module</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Individual AEM modules (WCM, DAM, Workflow, etc.)</li>
            <li> Runs on Granite platform, within OSGi framework</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Customer Applications (run on AEM)</h4>
           <ul>
            <li>Customer specific applications (websites, etc. also run within OSGi framework)</li>
          </ul>
    </div>
		<h4>OSGi Framework:</h4> 
		<p>The OSGi Framework is made up of three layers – Module, Lifecycle, and Services</p>
		<p>The responsibilities of the layers are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Module</strong> — Defines how a module, or a Bundle in OSGi-speak Basically, a bundle is just a plain old JAR file, 
					whose manifest file has	some defined entries. These entries identify the bundle with a symbolic name, a version and more. In addition there are headers which define what a bundle provides – Export-Package – and what a bundle requires
					to be operative – Import-Package and Require-Bundle.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Lifecycle</strong> — The lifecycle layer defines the states a bundle may be in and
					describes the state changes. By providing a class, which implements the
					BundleActivator interface and which is named in the Bundle-Activator
					manifest header, a bundle may hook into the lifecycle process when the
					bundle is started and stopped.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Services</strong> — For the application to be able to interact, the OSGi Core
					Specification defines the service layer. This describes a registry for
					services,which may be shared.
				</p>
			</li>

		</ul>
		

		
        
		<h4>Jackrabbit Oak:</h4> 
		<p>AEM 6.0 is now powered by the next generation repository implementation
			called Jackrabbit.

		</p>
		<p>The architecture of Oak was redesigned from scratch to offer improved performance and scalability and support massive content repositories.
		</p>

		<h4>Java Content Repository (JCR):</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>A Java Content Repository is an object database that provides various services
				for storing, accessing, and managing content.</li>
			<li>In addition to a hierarchically structured storage, common services of a content repository
				are versioning, access control, full text searching, and event monitoring.</li>
			<li>The JCR provides a generic application data store for both structured and
				unstructured content.
			</li>
			<li>File systems provide excellent storage for unstructured,hierarchical content.</li>
            <li>
            Databases provide excellent storage for structured data due to transactional services and referential integrity functionality.
            </li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Jetty 8:</h4>
		<p>An extensible, widely used open source web container supporting Servlets 3.0 specification, which has replaced the "own breed" CQSE used previously.</p>
        <h4>Apache Solr:</h4>
        <p>A scalable open source enterprise search platform, which can be configured as
        	embedded server or integrated external instance, to replace and extend
        	functionality of default search engine based on Lucene.
        </p>
        <h4>Apache Sling:</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Apache Sling is a web framework that uses a Java Content Repository, such as
				Apache Jackrabbit or Adobe CRX to store and manage content.</li>
        	<li> AEM is built using Sling, a Web application framework based on REST principles that provides easy development of content-oriented applications. </li>
        	<li>Sling applications use either scripts or Java servlets, selected based on simple
				name conventions, to process HTTP requests in a RESTful way.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Representational State Transfer (REST):</h4>

        <ul>
        	<li>REST stands for „REpresentational State Transfer</li>
        	<li> It‘s an “architectural style for designing distributed systems“ defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding </li>
        	<li>It‘s centered around the transfer of Representations of Resources</li>
        	<li>A resource can essentially be anything (but has to be addressable)</li>
        	<li>Resources are independent from their representation</li>
        	<li>An URL identifies a resource</li>
        	<li>Methods perform Operations on resources</li>
        	<li>HTTP status codes are used to indicate result success</li>
        </ul>
